## Introduction

A list in Python is an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after creation. This guide will walk you through the most common operations on Python lists.

## Creating Lists

You can create a list by placing a sequence of elements within square brackets `[]`.

```python
# An empty list
empty_list = []

# A list with elements
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
